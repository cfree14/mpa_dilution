MPA dilution

This project is organized using the following file structure:

1. Data - the input and output data
2. Code - the code used to perform all data manipulation, analysis, and visualization
3. Figures - the figures generated from the code

The raw input data (WDPA DBFs) have not been pushed to the GitHub repository due to their size and proprietary nature.
